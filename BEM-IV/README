It might be necessary to change the file path names for input and output files. That in all files,
In case of *_stepwise_folds.R files the output results are not save, you should save by yourself. They will be the threshold for a next step (Plot folder).
For each IV_list_kfolds_*.R a variable list is created which will be used in a next step (see the output file path name). 

Note: In all cases check the input and output files. The path of the files depends on the user's way of working.
