Here, we can find a necessary scripts to create each classifier and running in an independent way or parallel (a specific way).

First, using the ranking list gotten from BEM-IV, the scripts for each classifier is created.
Two files are riquired, IV_CLASSIFIER_template_DATASET.R and the corresding file with the ranking of variables 
(also the IV_CLASSIFIER_template_DATASET_r.R to restart the script). 

Then, the jobs_DATASET_CLASSIFIER.sh run each of the previous scripts. 

Note: In all cases check the input and output files. The path of the files depends on the user's way of working.
